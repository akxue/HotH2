# Mood for Thought #

Mood for Thought is a web app that allows users to receive 'mystery' recommendations from other users for a certain mood, and to recommend tidbits and media pertaining to a mood to other people around the world. It is built on node.js and webGL, and uses express, ajax, and jquery to transfer input between the site and the database stored with mongodb.
